vMODWAVE_0.2
============

- New "effect" Phase Bash. This is a technique described by Miller 
  Puckette (Pd) in his Theory and Technique of Electronic Music
  (http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/v0.11/book-html/node177.html) which
  uses frequency-domain processing to re-phase audio with the phase 
  start in the middle of the audio frame. This "phase bashing" creates
  frames which are significantly more Transwave-compatible, particularly
  when using normal audio as the wavetable source.

- New "effect" Zero-X, introduces a 16-sample power fade to 0 at the 
  frame edges. Transwave wavetables are expected to have zero-crossings
  at the frame boundaries to (help) avoid clicking.

- Normalization could introduce a DC offset, fixed to prevent this.

- Import operation could cause a reduced bank length to reset. Fixed.

- UI adjustments (improvements?) in the Effect Editor pane, now using
  checkboxes instead of two buttons per "All" operation.

- (macOS): minimum OS version reduced to 10.8 (from 10.11)

- Performance improvements: WaveEdit is written using a game engine
  application framework and isn't really optimized to do anything
  but peg 1 processor at 100% when it's open. The current version
  attempts to throttle processor usage to ~30% when the application
  is active and much less when it's in the background.

- Variable bank length: you can now set a bank length from 1 to 64
  frames (of 2048 samples) using the numerical selector at the top
  of the window.

- Morph...: this new button/popup on the Effect Editor pane provides
  a few useful wave interpolation options for populating a bank with
  waves derived from other waves. The current options are:

  - 0...END: interpolate between the wave at frame 0 and the wave at
    in the last frame (the index depends on the bank length), deleting
    anything in the middle. The first and last waves remain untouched.

  - Non-zero: interpolate across empty frames, so if you have samples
    in frames 2, 5, 6 and 9 of a bank with length=11, frames 0 and 1
    will be interpolated between silence and frame 2, frames 3-4 will
    be interpolated between frames 2 and 5, and frames 7-8 will be 
    interpolated between frames 6 and 9. Frames 10-11 will be interpolated
    back to silence. The non-zero frames remain untouched.

  - Adjacent: interpolate across adjacent frames, similar to the Morph-Z
    playback interpolation. Frame 0 will be linearly interpolated such that
    sample 0 is 100% frame 0 and 0% frame 1, sample 127 is 50% frame 0/
    50% frame 1, and sample 255 is 0% frame 0/100% frame 1. Only the
    final frame remains untouched.

- The actions in the Effect Editor pane have been moved from the bottom
  to the top of the window.

- The Waterfall view is no longer clipped at the bottom.

- WaveEdit Online has been updated to correctly import online waves
  into a 64-frame bank.
